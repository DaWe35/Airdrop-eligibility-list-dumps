# Crypto Airdrop Eligibility List Dumps

This repo contains unofficial eligible lists that I compiled for airdrops. The lists are not complete, many wallets can be missing, and it takes time to release them. Feel free to add wallets if you find more.

## Why?

Many projects are shady/lazy to release a public version of their airdrop eligibility lists. This does not make any sense (except if they want to hide something? idk), but it makes my job really hard to list these airdrops on https://airdropscan.io and to alert my users about their claimable airdrop.

Please, if you're running an airdrop, release a public CSV with addresses and amounts. Thank you.
